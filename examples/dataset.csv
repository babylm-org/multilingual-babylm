"The immune system is the set of tissues which work together to resist infections. The immune mechanisms help an organism identify a pathogen, and neutralize its threat.
The immune system can detect and identify many different kinds of disease agents. Examples are viruses, bacteria and parasites. The immune system can detect a difference between the body's own healthy cells or tissues, and 'foreign' cells. Detecting an unhealthy intruder is complicated, because intruders can evolve and adapt so that the immune system will no longer detect them.
Once a foreign cell or protein is detected, the immune system creates antibodies to fight the intruders, and sends special cells ('phagocytes') to eat them up.
Innate immune system.
Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess enzyme systems that protect against viral infections. Basic immune mechanisms appeared in ancient life forms and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and insects. These mechanisms include antimicrobial peptides (called defensins), phagocytosis, and the complement system. These make up the innate immune system, which defends the host from infections in a non-specific way. The simplest innate system is the cell wall or barrier on the outside to stop intruders getting in. For example, skin stops most outside bacteria getting in.
The response.
The innate immune system responds very quickly to anything foreign that enters the body. When something gets past the skin, as through a cut, the immune cells work to find the intruder and to alert each other of the foreign object. Small immune cells bring other cells from all over the body to the site where the foreign object was found. Other immune cells can send out messengers to cells nearby to have them help attack the foreign object. This process can make the skin look red and feel hot. Phagocyte cells eat anything foreign that enters the body. This response is called non-specific because it responds the same way to anything foreign that enters the body from germs to a piece of dust.
Adaptive immune system.
Vertebrates, including humans, have much more sophisticated defense mechanisms. The innate immune system is found in all metazoa, but the adaptive immune system is only found in vertebrates.
The adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to ""recognize and remember specific pathogens"". The system mounts stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered. It is adaptive, because the body's immune system prepares itself for future challenges.

"CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
“without pictures or conversations?”

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",child-books,PublicDomainStories,Latn,4-6,cc-by-sa,

"¡Qué hermosa era!

Pero ¡qué sello de dolor sobre su frente! ¡Qué lúgubre oscuridad en
sus bellos ojos! ¡Qué trágica expresión en todo su semblante! Algo muy
triste había en el fondo de su alma.

Y, sin embargo, no era una de aquellas mujeres excepcionales,
extravagantes, de corte romántico, que viven fuera del mundo devorando
algún pesar o representando alguna tragedia...

Era una mujer a la moda, una elegante mujer, de porte distinguido, cuya
menor palabra dejaba traslucir una de esas reinas de la conversación
y del buen gusto que tienen por trono una butaca de su gabinete, una
carretela en el Prado o un palco en la Ópera; pero que callan fuera de
su elemento, o sea fuera del círculo de sus iguales.

Con la llegada del día se alegró algo la encantadora viajera, y ya
consistiese en que mi circunspección de toda la noche y la gravedad de
mi fisonomía le inspirasen buena idea de mi persona, ya en que quisiera
recompensar al hombre a quien no había dejado dormir, fue el caso que
inició a su vez las cuestiones de ordenanza:

--¿Dónde va usted?

--¡Va a hacer buen día!

--¡Qué hermoso paisaje!

A lo que yo contesté más extensamente que ella me había contestado a mí.

Almorzamos en Colmenar.

Los viajeros del _interior_ y de la _rotonda_ eran personas poco
tratables.

Mi compañera se redujo a hablar conmigo.

Excusado es decir que yo estuve enteramente consagrado a ella y que la
atendí en la mesa como a una persona real.
